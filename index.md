# Yunfeng Xiong (熊云丰）

I am currently working at Peking Univeristy as Boya Postdoctoral Fellow. I got my Ph.D. degree of computational mathematics in June, 2020, at Peking University, China, under the supervision of Prof. Sihong Shao. The title of my thesis is _Many-body Wigner dynamics: Branching Random Walk and Particle Annihilation_.

# Research interest

My major research interest is the mathematical theory of particle methods, as well as their applications in solving high-dimensional PDEs arsing from the quantum physics and finances.  

The concept of particle method is closely related to the Monte Carlo methods. However, the usage of particle methods does not merely involve sampling process, but actually they are integrated applications of stochastic process, numerical mathematics, number theory, statistical learning, combinatorics, harmonic analysis and so on.

## Particle methods in quantum mechanics 

My graduate research concentrates on the particle method of the Wigner equation, a phase-space formulation of quantum dynamics initialized by Eugene Wigner. The fundamental obstacle is the **negative sign** in the probailistic model, which might be disliked by mathematicians majored in probability theory, but seems fundamental for physicists as the **negative probability** in quantum world manifests the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.  

After fighting with the notorious negative sign problem for five years, I have tried to understand its origin and made the first attempt to solve the Wigner equation on the 12-D phase space, with some developments in both particle generation and particle annihilation.
